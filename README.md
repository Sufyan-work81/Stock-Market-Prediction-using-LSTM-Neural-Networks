## Overview  
This project implements an LSTM-based neural network to predict stock market prices using historical data from Yahoo Finance. The model learns patterns from 13 years of Apple Inc. (AAPL) closing prices (2010-2023) to forecast future stock values. Developed as part of my work in financial data science, this solution demonstrates practical application of deep learning in quantitative finance.

Key features:  
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Uses sequence modeling with a 60-day window  
- **Deep Learning Architecture**: 2-layer LSTM network with dropout regularization  
- **Scalable Pipeline**: Complete workflow from data fetching to model training  
- **Production-Ready**: Saved model and scaler artifacts for deployment

## Requirements  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for full dependency list*

## Usage  

### 1. Training the Model  
Execute all cells in `Stock_market_prediction.ipynb` to:  
- Download historical stock data (2010-2023)  
- Preprocess and normalize data  
- Train the LSTM model  
- Save model (`stock_prediction_model.h5`) and scaler (`scaler.pkl`)  

### 2. Making Predictions  
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import joblib
import numpy as np

# Load artifacts
model = load_model('stock_prediction_model.h5')
scaler = joblib.load('scaler.pkl')

# Prepare input (last 60 days of closing prices)
last_60_days = [...]  # Your historical data here
scaled_data = scaler.transform(np.array(last_60_days).reshape(-1, 1)
input_sequence = np.reshape(scaled_data, (1, 60, 1))

# Generate prediction
predicted_scaled = model.predict(input_sequence)
predicted_price = scaler.inverse_transform(predicted_scaled)
print(f"Predicted next day closing price: ${predicted_price[0][0]:.2f}")
```

### 3. Output Visualization

*Validation loss decreases rapidly within 25 epochs with early stopping*

---

## Key Implementation Details  
- **Data Normalization**: MinMax scaling (0-1 range) using `sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`  
- **Sequence Length**: 60 trading days (~3 months historical context)  
- **Train/Test Split**: 80% training data (2010-2020), 20% testing  
- **Early Stopping**: Halts training if loss doesn't improve for 5 epochs  
- **Regularization**: 20% dropout between LSTM layers to prevent overfitting  
- **Optimization**: Adam optimizer with Mean Squared Error loss function

## Future Enhancements
Planned improvements:
- [ ] Real-time prediction API using Flask
- [ ] Integration of technical indicators (RSI, MACD)
- [ ] Sentiment analysis integration from financial news
- [ ] Multi-ticker support with comparative analysis

---

## Notes  
- Model performance depends on market volatility - retrain quarterly for best results
- For real-world use, consider:  
  - Adding fundamental analysis metrics  
  - Incorporating macroeconomic indicators  
  - Using walk-forward validation for robustness testing  
- **Disclaimer**: Predictions are for educational purposes only - not financial advice
